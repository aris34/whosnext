  "body": "# About the game   \r\nWho’s Next is a group-based (3 to 10 players), face-to-face quiz game about personal information. It aims to facilitate group members to get to know each other and break the ice during their first encounter.   \r\nAt first the players answer a set of questions about themselves, some of which encourage them to share interesting and personal details about themselves. During the game the players are supposed to select the correct person behind a given answer to a question.\r\n\r\nDuring game set-up, the user creating the game selects the group of questions asked in the beginning (based on the level of familiarity between the players) and the game duration.\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/4l9TRcT.png)   \r\n_Game setup and establishing connection with nearby devices using WiFi Direct_\r\n\r\nBefore the game starts, each player fills in his or her name and answers a short list of provided questions related to him or herself. After all players have answered a predefined list of questions (see Table 1 and Figure 1: left), the game starts and one of the players will have the turn – the active player. The task for the player in turn is to find out who is the other player who gave the specific answer to the question. \r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/ljNEYPx.png)   \r\n_Examples of the questions that the players have to answer before the game begins_\r\n\r\nThe active device shows a randomly selected question from the list, an answer from one of the players to that question, and a list of other players’ names to choose from. The other players have an inactive display simply stating “Please wait…” The game continues in the same manner for every player until the predefined time runs out or all the players’ answers have been used.\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/yoGU2Uy.png)   \r\n_The active player in each turn has to find the player who gave the shown answer_\r\n_Discussion between players is encouraged, but players can't reveal if it was them who gave the answer_\r\n\r\n##Implementation   \r\nThe devices are connected via Wi-Fi direct (using the [Wi-Fi Peer-to-Peer API](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/wifip2p.html)), enabling connectivity of multiple devices within the range of each other without the need for a separate wireless access point or internet connection.\r\n\r\nOne device acts as a server and others are clients. The server keeps track of the questions and answers being used (with the help of an [SQLite database](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/data-storage/databases.html)), randomly selects a pair of stored question-answer for each turn, selects which device will be up next, and broadcasts the messages to all the devices. When the countdown timer reaches 0 or all the elements from the question-answer list have been used, the game is over. The ending message is then broadcast to the clients. \r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/jf2xsXO.png)   \r\n_Score calculation at the end of the game_\r\n\r\nEach device is responsible for keeping track of its player performance (number of mistakes made and rounds completed), and calculating the user's individual score. All individual scores are transmitted back to the master device, which then calculates the group's total score. \r\n\r\n##Publications   \r\nJarusriboonchai, P., Malapaschas, A., Olsson, T.
